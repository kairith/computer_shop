			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<h3>Where can I purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan?</h3>
			<p>The AppleCare Protection Plan is available at the <a href="http://store.apple.com/uk">Apple Online Store</a> and many <a href="/id/buy/">Apple-authorised resellers and wireless service providers</a>.</p>

			<h3>How do I initiate repair service under the AppleCare Protection Plan?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Carry-in service</em>. Carry your product into an <a href="https://locate.apple.com/id/en/">Apple Authorised Service Provider</a>.</li>
				<li><em>Onsite service</em>. <a href="/id/support/contact/">Contact us</a> and we’ll help you arrange an Apple-authorised repair for your desktop Mac at your location, at no additional charge.</li>
				<li><em>Do-It-Yourself service</em>. <a href="/id/support/contact/">Contact us</a> and we may be able to send you what you need to service your own product, such as accessories.</li> 
			</ul>
			<p>The AppleCare Protection Plan for Mac, for iPod and for Apple TV provide global repair coverage. Service will be limited to the options available in the country where service is requested. Service options, parts availability and response times vary by country.</p>
			<p>All repairs will be completed using genuine Apple parts for repair service. All repairs are performed by Apple-authorised technicians.</p>
			<p>Please see the AppleCare Protection Plan <a href="/legal/sales-support/">Terms and Conditions</a> for complete details.</p>

			<h3>Is the AppleCare Protection Plan transferable?</h3>
			<p>Yes. If you choose to sell or give away your Apple product, you can also transfer the ownership of the AppleCare Protection Plan. Please see the <a href="/legal/sales-support/">Terms&nbsp;and&nbsp;Conditions</a> for complete details.</p>

			<h3>When I purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan, do I need to register it?</h3>
			<p>In most cases, if you purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan at the same time as your Apple hardware from selected Apple resellers, you will not need to register it as your AppleCare agreement will be automatically registered.</p>
			<p>With automatic registration, you will receive a proof of coverage, either immediately in the form of a receipt that indicates the end date of your AppleCare product coverage, or within 30 days in the form of a Proof of Coverage certificate.</p>
			<p>You’ll need to register your AppleCare Protection Plan only if you purchase the plan and your covered product separately, or if you purchase your hardware from a reseller who does not automatically register the plan.</p>
			<p>You can register your AppleCare Protection Plan <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204293">here</a> or contact Apple at the phone number included in your AppleCare Protection Plan package. To verify that your hardware is covered under the AppleCare Protection Plan, click <a href="https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do">here</a>. The registration process can take up to 24 hours to be visible in Apple’s systems.</p>
			
			<p>For example, after you register, Apple will have your hardware, AppleCare Protection Plan and personal contact information on file. When you contact Apple for service or support, Apple can access your information straight away and start addressing your issue, rather than spending time verifying your eligibility.</p>

			<h3>How can I verify how much coverage I have left?</h3>
